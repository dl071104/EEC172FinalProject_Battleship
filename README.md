# EEC172 WQ2025 Final Project Webpage - Battleship
 Group Member: Allison Li, Jason Kao
## Description
Our prototype will be a replica of the game battleship. This game will use two OLEDs, an IR receiver to input commands as well as save the name of the player, buttons on the microcontroller to navigate the interface, and AWS to store the scores and names of players.
Each player will take turns entering coordinates using the TV remote, and they will either receive a hit or miss. Players will take turns shooting at each ship until one side has sunk all the opposing ships, resulting in a winner.
